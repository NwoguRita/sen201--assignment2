SEN 201 SDLC Project
Lecture Attendance and Note Tracker System
The Lecture Attendance and Note Tracker System is a simple web-based application designed to help students record their lecture attendance and personal lecture notes. The system allows users to enter course details, mark lectures as attended or missed, and view a summary of attendance.
The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs directly in a web browser. It follows the basic stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The system is easy to use, student-friendly, and does not require any external software or database.
